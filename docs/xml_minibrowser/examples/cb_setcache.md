## setcache callback

!!! Demo
    [Try on your phone](xml/cb_setcache.xml)

**Example:** Holding the new setting until the *flush* fragment is called. At the *SnomIPPhoneText* with *page1* id, the *setcache* callback value for *fkey_label0* setting is shown **weather**. While it is recommended to using the square bracket on setting with array format, please avoid using that here.
