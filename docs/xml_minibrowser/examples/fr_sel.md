## sel fragment 

!!! Demo
    [Try on your phone](xml/fr_sel.xml)

Select the third option in *Menu*. If used alone, this fragment will work for *MenuItem* under *Menu*, which located directly under main element.
But if combined with [menu](fr_menu) fragment, this can be used to reach deeper level of *MenuItem*

```xml

```
